# Point Kinetics Equations Thesis
Github repository that contains all of the MATLAB component of my Bachelor's thesis in Mathematcal Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The object of my interest is numerical methods to solve the sistem of ODEs that defines the point Kinetics Equations, and benchmarks them to find the most effective ones. 

## PCA - Kinard
This folder contains a copy of all MATLAB files present in the thesis: **EFFICIENT NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE POINT KINETICS EQUATION** of Matthew Kinard, no change to them has been made. They are present in this repository in order to easily retrieve them for comparison between algorithms.
