# Point Kinetics Equations Thesis
Github repository that contains all of the MATLAB component of my Bachelor's thesis in Mathematcal Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The object of my interest is numerical methods to solve the sistem of ODEs that defines the point Kinetics Equations, and benchmarks them to find the most effective ones. 

**This project is still under development.**
